# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
# This CFU was by far the most difficult CFU that I've experienced, and it showed Kevin and I that we really need to brush up and review everything that we have learned so far. Doing each lesson piece by piece was not very difficult, but combining everything and applying it to actual problems was a tremendous task that we were not able to completely resolve. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
# Workflow is good. I need to spend more time reviewing, but other than that, I feel comfortable with how much time I spend on the content. I will continue to monitor my status and see if I need to spend even more time as Mod 1 begins.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
# Review. Review. Review. Bake it into memory.
